	<para>
		To illustrate the capabilities of MobilityDB, we give an example use case that loads, explores, and query mobility data. The data used is based on the MobilityDB <ulink url="https://github.com/MobilityDB/MobilityDB-BerlinMOD">implementation</ulink> of the <ulink url="http://dna.fernuni-hagen.de/secondo/BerlinMOD/BerlinMOD.html">BerlinMOD</ulink> benchmark for moving object databases. The data is available as a <ulink url="https://docs.mobilitydb.com/data/berlinmod_data.zip">ZIP</ulink> file.

		<title>Installation</title>

		<para>
			For this tutorial we can use two alternative installations:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>Install from sources</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Use a Docker image containing MobilityDB and all its dependencies (including PostgreSQL and PostGIS)</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		We explain first the installation from sources and later in this section we explain the installation using a Docker image.
		</para>

		<para>
			In order to use this tutorial you must first have MobilityDB installed in your system. We refer to the MobilityDB <ulink url="https://github.com/MobilityDB/MobilityDB">documentation</ulink> for doing this task. Then we can install the MobilityDB-BerlinMOD tutorial as follows.
				<programlisting language="bash" xml:space="preserve">
git clone https://github.com/MobilityDB/MobilityDB-BerlinMOD.git
cd MobilityDB-BerlinMOD/BerlinMOD
</programlisting>
		</para>

		<para>
		We explain now how to explore this tutorial using a Docker image that contains MobilityDB and all its dependencies (including PostgreSQL and PostGIS). The container has a default database called <varname>mobilitydb</varname> with the MobilityDB extension installed where <varname>user = pw = docker</varname>. This presupposes that you have installed Docker into your computer. In that case, you can run the following command.
			<programlisting language="bash" xml:space="preserve">
docker pull codewit/mobilitydb
docker volume create mobilitydb_data
docker run --name "mobilitydb" -d -p 25432:5432 -v mobilitydb_data:/var/lib/postgresql 
codewit/mobilitydb
</programlisting>
			In the above commands
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para><varname>docker pull</varname> downloads the Docker image of <varname>mobilitydb</varname>. If the image has been downloaded before, this checks whether a more recent image has been published in the docker repository, and downloads it. It is better to call this command every time, to ensures that you have the latest most up-to-date version of this image.</para></listitem>

				<listitem><para><varname>docker volume create mobilitydb_data</varname> creates a volume container on the host, that we will use to persist the PostgreSQL database files outside of the MobilityDB container. You need to run this command only once, during the first use of the image</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem><para><varname>docker run --name=mobilitydb</varname> tells Docker our new container will be named <varname>mobilitydb</varname>.</para></listitem>

				<listitem><para><varname>-d</varname> runs the container in the background (detached mode).</para></listitem>

				<listitem><para><varname>-p 25432:5432</varname> maps TCP port 5432 in the container to port 25432 on the Docker host (to prevent potential conflicts with any local database instance you may have). This is required because the PostgreSQL database server in the container listens for connections on port 5432 by default.</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem><para><varname>-v mobilitydb_data:/var/lib/postgresql</varname> tells the container filesystem to mount the <varname>mobilitydb_data</varname> volume that we have just created to the path /var/lib/postgresql. This means that any database objects that the container saves or creates (by default in <varname>/var/lib/postgresql</varname>) will instead be persisted in the <varname>mobilitydb_data</varname> directory, which is stored in the host. This options ensures that your data will not be lost when the container is removed. </para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem><para><varname>codewit/mobilitydb</varname> tells Docker to pull the docker image with that name from Docker Hub.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>

		<para>
		Now we can launch any PostgreSQL administrative front-end to start using MobilityDB. Two traditional ones are the command-line tool <varname>psql</varname> and the graphical tool <varname>pgAdmin</varname>. We can launch <varname>psql</varname> as follows.
			<programlisting language="bash" xml:space="preserve">
docker exec -t -i mobilitydb psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d mobilitydb -U docker
</programlisting>
			In the above command
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para><varname>docker exec -t -i mobilitydb psql</varname> tells Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY, to keep STDIN open, and to execute in the container <varname>mobilitydb</varname> the command <varname>psql</varname>.</para></listitem>

				<listitem><para><varname>-h localhost -p 5432 -d mobilitydb -U docker</varname> tells <varname>psql</varname>, respectively, the database server host, the server port, the database name, and the user name.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			Note that you will be prompted to provide the password, which is also <varname>docker</varname>.
		</para>

		<para>
		In order to launch <varname>pgAdmin</varname>, there are two options to create a connection. The first option is to set the host to the localhost (127.0.0.1), and the port to the mapped one on the host, as per the <varname>docker run</varname> command. In this example the port is 25432. Now we can launch <varname>pgAdmin</varname> and establish a new connection to the docker container. This is done as shown in <xref linkend="pgAdmin" />. 
		</para>

		<figure id="pgAdmin" float="start"><title>Configuration of a connection to the docker image in pgAdmin.</title>
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject><imagedata scale='50' fileref='images/pgAdmin.png' /></imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		</figure>

		<para>
		The second option is to know the IP address used by docker container with the following command.
			<programlisting language="bash" xml:space="preserve">
docker-machine ip
-- 192.168.99.101
</programlisting>
			Notice that the address obtained in your computer may be different from the one above. Now we can launch <varname>pgAdmin</varname> and establish a new connection to the docker container. This is done as shown in <xref linkend="pgAdmin" />. The second option is to set the host to the localhost (127.0.0.1), and the port to the mapped one on the host, as per the <varname>docker run</varname> command. In this example the port would be 25432.
		</para>

		<para>
		Now you can use pgAdmin to query the mobilitydb database, as will be further explained in the following sections. Here are few more docker commands that you will eventually need:
		<programlisting language="bash" xml:space="preserve">
docker stop "mobilitydb"
docker start "mobilitydb"
docker rm "mobilitydb"
</programlisting>
			The above commands
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para><varname>docker stop</varname> shuts down the docker container. You need to issue this command, for example, if you need to re-start the host.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para><varname>docker start</varname> launches back the docker container. You need to issue this command, for example, after re-starting the host.</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para><varname>docker rm</varname> removes/deletes docker container. You need to issue this command, for example, if you need to <varname>docker pull</varname> a more recent MobilityDB image. If the databases are stored in a <varname>docker volume</varname> as explained above, it will still be available after downloading and running the new image.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

		<title>Loading the Data</title>

		<para>The ZIP file with the data for this tutorial contains a set of CSV files as follows:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para><varname>instants.csv</varname> with fields <varname>InstantId</varname> and <varname>Instant</varname> contains timestamps used for queries.</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para><varname>licences.csv</varname> with fields <varname>LicenceId</varname>, <varname>Licence</varname> and <varname>VehicleId</varname> contains vehicle licences used for queries.</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para><varname>periods.csv</varname> with fields <varname>PeriodId</varname>, <varname>Begin</varname>, and <varname>End</varname> contains periods used for the queries.</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para><varname>points.csv</varname> with fields <varname>PointId</varname>, <varname>PosX</varname>, and <varname>PosY</varname> contains points used for queries.</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para><varname>regions.csv</varname> with fields <varname>RegionId</varname>, <varname>PointNo</varname>, <varname>PosX</varname>, and <varname>PosY</varname> and <varname>Yend</varname> contains the polygons used for queries.</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para><varname>trips.csv</varname> with fields <varname>TripId</varname>, <varname>VehicleId</varname>, <varname>PosX</varname>, <varname>PosY</varname>, and <varname>Instant</varname> contains vehicles movements and pauses.</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para><varname>vehicles.csv</varname> with fields <varname>VehicleId</varname>, <varname>Licence</varname>, <varname>VehicleType</varname>, and <varname>Model</varname> contains the vehicle descriptions.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>

		<para>
		We decompress the file with the data into a directory. This can be done using the command. 
			<programlisting language="bash" xml:space="preserve">
unzip berlinmod_data.zip
</programlisting>
		We suppose in the following that the directory used is as follows <varname>/home/mobilitydb/data/</varname>.
		</para>

		<para>
		In the following, we can use the <varname>mobilitydb</varname> database provided in the container. This database has already installed the MobilityDB extension. Alternatively, you may use another database. In that case, you can install the MobilityDB extension in your database by using the following command.
			<programlisting language="sql" xml:space="preserve">
CREATE EXTENSION MobilityDB CASCADE;
</programlisting>
		By using <varname>CASCADE</varname> we load the required PostGIS extension prior to loading MobilityDB.
		</para>

		<para>We create the tables to be loaded with the data in the CSV files as follows.
			<programlisting language="sql" xml:space="preserve">
CREATE TABLE Instants (
  InstantId integer PRIMARY KEY,
  Instant timestamptz NOT NULL );
CREATE TABLE Periods (
  PeriodId integer PRIMARY KEY,
  Tstart TimestampTz NOT NULL,
  Tend TimestampTz NOT NULL,
  Period tstzspan );
CREATE TABLE Points (
  PointId integer PRIMARY KEY,
  PosX double precision NOT NULL,
  PosY double precision NOT NULL,
  Geom Geometry(Point) );
CREATE TABLE RegionsInput (
  RegionId integer,
  PointNo integer,
  XPos double precision NOT NULL,
  YPos double precision NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (RegionId, PointNo) );
CREATE TABLE Regions (
  RegionId integer PRIMARY KEY,
  Geom Geometry(Polygon) NOT NULL );
CREATE TABLE Vehicles (
  VehicleId integer PRIMARY KEY,
  Licence text NOT NULL,
  VehicleType text NOT NULL,
  Model text NOT NULL );
CREATE TABLE Licences (
  LicenceId integer PRIMARY KEY,
  Licence text NOT NULL,
  VehicleId integer NOT NULL REFERENCES Vehicles(VehicleId) );
CREATE TABLE TripsInput (
  TripId integer NOT NULL,
  VehicleId integer NOT NULL REFERENCES Vehicles(VehicleId),
  PosX float NOT NULL,
  PosY float NOT NULL,
  t timestamptz NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (TripId, t) );
CREATE TABLE Trips (
  TripId integer PRIMARY KEY,
  VehicleId integer NOT NULL REFERENCES Vehicles(VehicleId),
  Trip tgeompoint NOT NULL );
</programlisting>
		We created one table for each CSV file. In addition, we created a table <varname>Regions</varname> in order to assemble all points composing the polygon  of a region into a single geometry and a table <varname>Trips</varname> in order to assemble all instants composing a trip into a single temporal point.
		</para>

		<para>
		We can load the CSV files into the corresponding tables as follows.
			<programlisting language="sql" xml:space="preserve">

		<para>The following query is used to load table <varname>Regions</varname> from the data in table <varname>RegionsInput</varname>.
			<programlisting language="sql" xml:space="preserve">

FROM RegionsInput
GROUP BY RegionId;
</programlisting>
		There are many nested functions, so reading from the innermost:
			<itemizedlist>

		<title>Loading the Data in Partitioned Tables</title>
		<para>
		PostgreSQL provides partitioning mechanisms so that large tables can be split in smaller physical tables. This may result in increased performance when querying and manipulating large tables. We will split the <varname>Trips</varname> table given in the previous section using list partitioning, where each partitition will contain all the trips that start at a particular date. For doing this, we use the procedure given next for automatically creating the partitions according to a date range.
		</para>
		<programlisting language="sql" xml:space="preserve">
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_partitions_by_date(TableName TEXT, StartDate DATE,
  EndDate DATE)

</programlisting>

		<para>In order to partition table <varname>Trips</varname> by date we need to add an addition column <varname>TripDate</varname> to table <varname>TripsInput</varname>.
			<programlisting language="sql" xml:space="preserve">
ALTER TABLE TripsInput ADD COLUMN TripDate DATE;
UPDATE TripsInput t1 
SET TripDate = t2.TripDate
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT TripId, date_trunc('day', MIN(t) OVER (PARTITION BY TripId))
AS TripDate FROM TripsInput) t2
WHERE t1.TripId = t2.TripId;
</programlisting>
		Notice that the <varname>UPDATE</varname> statement above takes into account the fact that a trip may finish at a day later than the starting day.
		</para>

		<para>
		The following statements create table <varname>Trips</varname> partitioned by date and the associated partitions.
			<programlisting language="sql" xml:space="preserve">

		</para>

		<para>
		To see the partitions that have been created automatically we can use the following statement.
			<programlisting language="sql" xml:space="preserve">
SELECT I.inhrelid::regclass AS child
FROM pg_inherits I
WHERE i.inhparent = 'trips'::regclass;

		In our case this would result in the following output.
			<programlisting language="sql" xml:space="preserve">

</programlisting>
		</para>

		<para>We modify the query that loads table <varname>Trips</varname> from the data in table <varname>TripsInput</varname> as follows.
			<programlisting language="sql" xml:space="preserve">
INSERT INTO Trips
SELECT TripId, TripDate, VehicleId, tgeompoint_seq(array_agg(tgeompoint_inst(

		<title>Querying the Data</title>
		<para>We discuss next four categories of queries: range queries, distance queries, temporal aggregate queries, and nearest-neighbor queries.</para>

		<sect2>
			<title>Range Queries</title>
			<para>The queries in this category restrict Trips with respect to a spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal point or range. In the examples, the spatial points and ranges are given, respectively, in tables <varname>Points</varname> and <varname>Regions</varname>, while temporal points and ranges are given, respectively, in tables <varname>Instants</varname> and <varname>Periods</varname>.</para>

					<para>This is a spatial range query. The query verifies that the trajectory of the vehicle intersects the region. PostGIS performs an implicit bounding box comparison <varname>trajectory(t.Trip) &amp;&amp; r.Geom</varname> using the spatial index on table <varname>Regions</varname> when executing the predicate <varname>ST_Intersects</varname>.</para>

					<para>This is a spatio-temporal range query. The query performs a bounding box comparison with the <varname>&amp;&amp;</varname> operator using the spatio-temporal index on table <varname>Trips</varname>. After that, the query verifies that the location of the vehicle during the period intersects the region. Notice the predicate <varname>eIntersects</varname> (ever intersects) that is applied to the arguments <varname>atTime(Trip, p.Period)</varname> and <varname>r.Geom</varname>.</para>

					<para>The query selects a trip and a point and verifies that the vehicle passed by the point by testing that the trajectory of the trip contains the point. Notice that PostGIS will perform the bounding box containment <varname>trajectory(t.Trip) ~ p.Geom</varname> using the spatial index on table <varname>Points</varname> before executing <varname>ST_Contains</varname>. Then, the query projects the trip to the point with the <varname>atValue</varname> function, get the first timestamp of the projected trip with the <varname>startTimestamp</varname> function, and applies the traditional <varname>MIN</varname> aggregate function for all trips of the vehicle and the point.</para>

		<sect2>
			<title>Temporal Aggregate Queries</title>
			<para>There are three common types of temporal aggregate queries.
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>Instant temporal aggregate queries in which, from a conceptual perspective, the traditional aggregate function is applied at each instant.</para>
					</listitem>

					<listitem>
						<para>Window temporal aggregate queries (also known as cumulative queries), which, given a time interval w, compute the value of the aggregate at a time instant t from the values during the time period [t-w, t].</para>
					</listitem>

					<listitem>
						<para>Span temporal aggregate queries, which, first, split the time line into predefined intervals independently of the target data, and then, for each of these intervals, aggregate the data that overlap the interval.</para>

					<para>This an instant temporal aggregate query. For each period, the query projects the trips to the given period and applies the temporal count to the projected trips.

					<para>This is a window temporal aggregate query. Suppose that we are computing pollution levels by region. Since the effect of a vehicle passing at a location lasts some time interval, this is a typical case for window aggregates. For each region, the query computes the spatial projection of the trips to the given region and apply the window temporal count to the projected trips. The condition in the <varname>WHERE</varname> clause is used for filtering the trips with the spatio-temporal index. The condition in the <varname>HAVING</varname> clause is used for removing regions that do not intersect with any trip.</para>

		<sect2>
			<title>Nearest-Neighbor Queries</title>
			<para>There are three common types of nearest-neighbor queries in spatial databases.
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) queries find the k nearest points to a given point.</para>
					</listitem>

					<listitem>

				</itemizedlist>
			</para>

			<para>The above types of queries are generalized to temporal points. However, the complexity of these queries depend on whether the reference object and the candidate objects are static or moving. In the examples that follow we only consider the nontemporal version of the nearest-neighbor queries, that is, the one in which the calculation is performed on the projection of temporal points on the spatial dimension. The temporal version of the nearest-neighbor queries remains to be done.</para>

			<orderedlist continuation="continues">

					<para>This is a nearest-neighbor query with moving reference objects and static candidate objects. The query above uses PostgreSQL's lateral join, which intuitively iterates over each row in a result set and evaluates a subquery using that row as a parameter. The query starts by computing the trajectory of the trips in the temporary table <varname>TripsTraj</varname>. Then, given a trip <varname>t</varname> in the outer query, the subquery computes the traditional distance between the trajectory of <varname>t</varname> and each point <varname>p</varname>. The <varname>ORDER BY</varname> and <varname>LIMIT</varname> clauses in the inner query select the three closest points.

					<para>This is a nearest-neighbor query where both the reference and the candidate objects are moving. Therefore, it is not possible to proceed as in the previous query to first project the moving points to the spatial dimension and then compute the traditional distance. Given a trip <varname>t1</varname> in the outer query, the subquery computes the temporal distance between <varname>t1</varname> and a trip <varname>t2</varname> of another vehicle different from the vehicle from <varname>t1</varname> and then computes the minimum value in the temporal distance.

					<para>This is a reverse nearest-neighbor query where both the reference and the candidate objects are moving. The query starts by computing the corresponding nearest-neighbor query in the temporary table <varname>TripDistances</varname> as it is done in Query 14. Then, in the main query it verifies for each pair of trips <varname>t1</varname> and <varname>t2</varname> that both belong to the <varname>TripDistances</varname> table.</para>

					<para>This is an aggregate nearest-neighbor query. The temporary table <varname>Groups</varname> splits the vehicles in groups where the <varname>GroupId</varname> column takes the values from 1 to total number of groups. The temporary table <varname>SumDistances</varname> computes for each group <varname>g</varname> and point <varname>p</varname> the sum of the distances between a trip of a vehicle in the group and the point. The main query then selects for each group in table <varname>SumDistances</varname> the points(s) that have the minimum aggregated distance.</para>
